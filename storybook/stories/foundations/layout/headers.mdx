# Headers
Headers provide a high-level overview, and access to actions relating to a specific UI section. A standardised design gives users a predictable way to complete common tasks.

While the general composition is consistent, there are two different header patterns to use, based on density. 

## Low density

<HeaderExampleLowDensity />

* Use the low density header pattern in the primary section of an admin page. 
* Always include a visible title, typically using the `h2` element.
* Include no more than one visible action.
* Secondary actions are accessible via 'More actions' menu.
* Include a summary/description where appropriate, but keep it short.
* Use a 'Back' icon-button to provide access to the parent secton

## High density

<HeaderExampleHighDensity />

* Use the high density header pattern in narrower, secondary sections and editor panels.
* Contain all actions in a Menu.
* Always include a visible title, typically using the `h3` element, and use a smaller font size, typically `$font-size-medium`.
* Optionally include a decorative element like an icon or an image. This element should be `24px` x `24px` and relate directly to the title.
* Use a 'Back' icon-button to provide access to the parent secton
